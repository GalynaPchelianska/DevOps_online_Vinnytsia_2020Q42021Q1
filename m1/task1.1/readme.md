I created a GitHub account and created a private repository there. The repository consisted of folders and subfolders. 
Then with the help of Git I cloned a repo on my workstation. Created and modified various files and folders.
I created different versions (branches) of the repo, in which I changed the files included in them. 
In the end, I merged all the branches of the repo and fixed the conflict in the index.html. I pushed lates changes into Githab repo.
